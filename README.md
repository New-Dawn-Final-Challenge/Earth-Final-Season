## Overview

**Earth: Final Season** is a reality showâ€”except it's not on TV. You play as the host, an alien controlling influential figures to spread chaos, destruction, and pollution to maximize audience ratings. The game combines strategy and decision-making with a satirical twist.

- **Tap buttons**: Choose specific actions based on events.
- **Balance Indicators**: Keep **Ill Being**, **Environmental Degradation**, and **Social Political Instability** in check.

- **Multiple Endings**: Custom conclusions based on decisions and game state.

## Game Over Conditions

## Developer Features

Earth: Final Season is built with a focus on performance, modularity, and scalability using modern Apple technologies:

- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework for seamless and dynamic interfaces.
- **Core ML**: Powers AI-driven decisions for procedural event generation.
- **Metal**: Handles advanced rendering and effects for an immersive experience.
- **Swift Package Manager**: Streamlines dependency management.
- **CloudKit**: Enables cloud-based storage and game synchronization.
- **Combine**: Manages reactive programming and data flow.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures clean code separation and scalability.

## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow

- **Main**: Stable branch, only merges from `develop`.
- **Develop**: Latest tested version, merges feature branches.
- **Feature Branches**: Named `feature/idTask-title`, e.g., `feature/304-create-login-view`.

### Architecture

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
- Organized by feature: Each feature has its own View, ViewModel, and Model.
